Code from the period of working in Microsoft ILDC education team
Includes:
1) Misconception Analysis / Error pattern analysis	Detecting misconception - error patterns in studentsâ€™ answers to open-ended questions. We offer different tools, models and approaches to detect common errors across questions and across students and evaluate their feasibility in our data.

2) Balanced Sampling for CET experiment - split students to experimental groups while ensuring balance representation of each class, and of weak, medium and strong students within each class (based on students pre-test scores)

3) Online feature computation for CET experiment - Online evaluation of the students answers to questions in CET data, comparison between groups, folders and between online and offline features
